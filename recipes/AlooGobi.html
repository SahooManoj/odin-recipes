    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gobi Aloo is a classic vegetarian dish in Indian cuisine, featuring a harmonious blend of cauliflower and potatoes. 
        These vegetables are cooked together with a medley of spices including turmeric, cumin, and garam masala, which infuse 
        the dish with deep, earthy flavors. The cauliflower’s slight bitterness and the potato’s mild sweetness create a 
        perfect balance, resulting in a dish that is both comforting and flavorful.
    </p>
    <p>
        This vibrant dish, often yellow from the turmeric, is a staple in many Indian households. 
        It is typically served as a main course alongside roti, naan, or rice, making it a versatile option for lunch or dinner. 
        The simplicity of Gobi Aloo, combined with its rich taste, ensures its place as a favorite in Indian cuisine, 
        enjoyed by both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.

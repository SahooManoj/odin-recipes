    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Naan is a quintessential Indian flatbread known for its soft, chewy texture and slightly crispy exterior. 
        Traditionally baked in a tandoor, or clay oven, naan develops a unique flavor profile that is both smoky and slightly charred, 
        making it an irresistible accompaniment to a wide range of Indian dishes. Whether served plain or enhanced with toppings 
        like garlic or butter, naan is a versatile bread that complements the flavors of rich curries and hearty stews.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often enjoyed fresh out of the oven, naan is brushed with ghee or butter to add a layer of richness. 
        Its ability to scoop up sauces and hold flavors makes it an integral part of the Indian dining experience, 
        whether paired with spicy curries or enjoyed as a base for wraps and sandwiches.

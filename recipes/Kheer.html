    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Kheer is a beloved Indian dessert that embodies the essence of traditional sweet dishes. Made by simmering rice 
        in a mixture of milk and sugar, this dish transforms into a creamy and luxurious pudding that is often flavored 
        with cardamom for a warm, aromatic finish. The subtle sweetness of the milk pairs beautifully with the fragrant spices, 
        creating a rich and comforting dessert that is both indulgent and satisfying.

        Kheer is commonly garnished with a variety of nuts such as almonds and pistachios, which add a delightful crunch 
        to its smooth texture. Raisins are also sometimes mixed in for an added layer of sweetness. This versatile dessert 
        is a staple at festive occasions and celebrations in India, offering a taste of warmth and tradition in every bite.
